## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process
At first I did the html file for desktop. I tried to use HTML5. Then, I did the styling and then some coding to add functionality. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I should always do the mobile version first. Then, do the desktop version. Because, It's easier. 

### Continued development
